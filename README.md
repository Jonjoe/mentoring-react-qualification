In this stage you will continue the evolution of your app by adding storybooks to it

- **Stage 5**: Testing Approach & Patterns

From section 2 you will take the app you worked on and evolve it one step at a time. The code folder will give you an example of the expected end result. 

Please post any issues you have with the example code, course format or typos ... typos are my thing ...
